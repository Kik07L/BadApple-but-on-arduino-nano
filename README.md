to make it work u need to plug in ur aruino into a pc with python and arduino software installed
then upload the code onto your arduino nano
finally search the "COM" your arduino is using to comunicate with ur pc 
and put that into the "COM" thing in the index.py file ( by default it's COM5 ) 
then launch the index.py
and tada you have bad apple playing in a low framerate and bad resolution :D enjoy 
can also read any video u name bad_apple.mp4 into and put it into the folder btw
